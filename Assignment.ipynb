He started working on Python in December 1989 and released the first version of the language, version 0.9.0, in February 1991. Since then, Python has undergone many changes and updates, and it has grown in popularity to become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world."

    "\n",
    "myVar = 10\n",

    "If you then try to print the value of myVar, Python will raise an error because myVar was not defined:\n",
